VivaGraphJS - JavaScript Graph Drawing Library
==================================================
**VivaGraphJS** is a free [graph drawing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_drawing) library for JavaScript.
It is designed to be extensible and to support different rendering engines and layout algorithms. At the moment
it supports rendering graphs using WebGL, SVG or CSS formats. Layout algorithms currently implemented are:

* [Force Directed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force-based_algorithms_\(graph_drawing\)) - based on Barnes-Hut
simulation and optimized for JavaScript language this algorithm gives `N * lg(N) + V` performance per iteration. 
* [ ![PDF download](https://github.com/anvaka/VivaGraphJS/raw/master/packages/Images/pdf-icon.gif) GEM](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.113.9565&rep=rep1&type=pdf) - Graph Embedder
algorithm created by Arne Frick, Andreas Ludwig and Heiko Mehldau. Estimated compleixity of this algorithm
is `O(|V|^3)` - though I must have made a mistake somewhere, because force directed algorithm almost
always produces better results faster. This algorithm is included to demonstrate how
one can implement a new layout algorithm.

Library provides API which tracks graph changes and reflect changes on the rendering surface
accordingly.


Enough talking. Show me the demo!
----------------------------------------------------
Some examples of library usage in the real projects:

* [Amazon Visualization](http://www.yasiv.com/amazon#/Search?q=graph%20drawing&category=Books&lang=US) Shows related products on Amazon.com, uses SVG as graph output
* [YouTube Visualization](http://www.yasiv.com/youtube#/Search?q=write%20in%20c) Shows related videos from YouTube. SVG based.
* [Facebook Visualization](http://www.yasiv.com/facebook) friendship visualization on Facebook. WebGL based.
* [Graph Viewer](http://www.yasiv.com/graphs#Bai/rw496) visualization of sparse matrices collection of the University of Florida. WebGL based.
* [Vkontakte Visualization](http://www.yasiv.com/vk) friendship visualization of the largest social network in Russia [vk.com](vk.com). WebGL based.

To start using the library include `vivagraph.js` script from the [dist](https://github.com/anvaka/VivaGraphJS/tree/master/dist) folder. The following code is the minimum required to render a graph with two nodes and one edge:

```javascript
var graph = Viva.Graph.graph();
graph.addLink(1, 2);

var renderer = Viva.Graph.View.renderer(graph);
renderer.run();
```

This will produce the following layout:

![Simple graph](https://github.com/anvaka/VivaGraphJS/raw/master/packages/Images/mingraph.png)

The code above adds a link to the graph between nodes `1` and `2`. Since nodes are not yet in the graph
they will be created. It's equivalent to 

```javascript
var graph = Viva.Graph.graph();
graph.addNode(1);
graph.addNode(2);
graph.addLink(1, 2);

var renderer = Viva.Graph.View.renderer(graph);
renderer.run();
```


Customization
----------------------------------------------------
VivaGraphJS is all about customization. You can easily change the appearance of nodes and links. You can also change the layouting algorithm and medium that displays elements of the graph. For example: The following code allows you to use CSS-based rendering, instead of the default SVG.

```javascript
var graph = Viva.Graph.graph();
graph.addLink(1, 2);

var graphics = Viva.Graph.View.cssGraphics();

var renderer = Viva.Graph.View.renderer(graph, 
    {
        graphics : graphics
    });
renderer.run();
```

`graphics` class is responsible for rendering nodes and links on the page. And `renderer` orchestrates the process. To change nodes appearance tell `graphics` how to represent them. Here is an example of graph with six people who I follow at github:

```javascript
var graph = Viva.Graph.graph();

// Construct the graph
graph.addNode('anvaka', {url : 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/91bad8ceeec43ae303790f8fe238164b'});
graph.addNode('manunt', {url : 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/c81bfc2cf23958504617dd4fada3afa8'});
graph.addNode('thlorenz', {url : 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/1c9054d6242bffd5fd25ec652a2b79cc'});
graph.addNode('bling', {url : 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/24a5b6e62e9a486743a71e0a0a4f71af'});
graph.addNode('diyan', {url : 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/01bce7702975191fdc402565bd1045a8?'});
graph.addNode('pocheptsov', {url : 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/13da974fc9716b42f5d62e3c8056c718'});
graph.addNode('dimapasko', {url : 'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8e587a4232502a9f1ca14e2810e3c3dd'});

graph.addLink('anvaka', 'manunt');
graph.addLink('anvaka', 'thlorenz');
graph.addLink('anvaka', 'bling');
graph.addLink('anvaka', 'diyan');
graph.addLink('anvaka', 'pocheptsov');
graph.addLink('anvaka', 'dimapasko');

// Set custom nodes appearance
var graphics = Viva.Graph.View.svgGraphics();
graphics.node(function(node) {
       // The function is called every time renderer needs a ui to display node
       return Viva.Graph.svg('image')
             .attr('width', 24)
             .attr('height', 24)
             .link(node.data.url); // node.data holds custom object passed to graph.addNode();
    })
    .placeNode(function(nodeUI, pos){
        // Shift image to let links go to the center:
        nodeUI.attr('x', pos.x - 12).attr('y', pos.y - 12);
    });

var renderer = Viva.Graph.View.renderer(graph, 
    {
        graphics : graphics
    });
renderer.run();
```

The result is:

Tuning layout algorithm
----------------------------------------------------
Graphs vary by their nature. Some graphs have hundreds of nodes and few edges (or links), somew might connect every node with every other. Tuning the physics often helps get the best layout.
Consider the following example:

```javascript
var graphGenerator = Viva.Graph.generator();
var graph = graphGenerator.grid(3, 3);
var renderer = Viva.Graph.View.renderer(graph);
renderer.run();
```

Graph generators are part of the library, which can produce classic graphs. `grid` generator creates a grid with given number of columns and rows. But with default parameters the rendering is pretty ugly:

![Grid 3x3 bad](https://github.com/anvaka/VivaGraphJS/raw/master/packages/Images/gridBad.png)

Let's tweak the original code:

```javascript
var graphGenerator = Viva.Graph.generator();
var graph = graphGenerator.grid(3, 3);

var layout = Viva.Graph.Layout.forceDirected(graph, {
    springLength : 10,
    springCoeff : 0.0005,
    dragCoeff : 0.02,
    gravity : -1.2
});

var renderer = Viva.Graph.View.renderer(graph, {
    layout : layout
});
renderer.run();
```

Now the result is much better:

![Grid 3x3](https://github.com/anvaka/VivaGraphJS/raw/master/packages/Images/gridGood.png)

Tuning layout algorithm is definitely one of the hardest part of using this library. It has to be improved in future to simplify usage. Each of the force directed algorithm parameters are described in the source code.

`TODO: Add more examples and library API to wiki`

I need your feedback
----------------------------------------------------
Disclaimer: I wrote this library to learn JavaScript. By no means I pretend to be an expert in the language and choosen approach to design may not be the optimal. I would love to hear your feedback and suggestions. 

Though I implemented this library from scratch, I went through many existing libraries to pick the best (at my view) out of them. If you are evaluating libraries for your project make sure to check them out as well:

* [Dracula Graph Library](https://github.com/strathausen/dracula) - written by [Johann Philipp Strathausen](https://github.com/strathausen) and uses [RaphaÃ«l](http://raphaeljs.com/) library to render graphs. Has very simple API.
* [D3](http://mbostock.github.com/d3/ex/force.html) - one of the best data visualization library in JavaScript world. From [Mike Bostock](https://github.com/mbostock).

My goal is to create highly performant javascript library which serves in the field of graph drawing. To certain extent I ahcieved it. But I have no doubt there is much more to improve here.
